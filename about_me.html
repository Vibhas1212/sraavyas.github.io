<p style=font-size:180%;" class="b">Q.&emsp;Who am I? <br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I am Sraavya, a 12 year <strike>old</strike> young girl who loves to read books!
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is my height?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I am 5’6. Which is not good, but still people tell me that I am really tall. I guess it comes from my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;parents….
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What do I like to do in my free time?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I would be free in my free time!
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What do I like to eat?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I am a total Delhiite in the field of eating! I love Chole Bhature, Pani Puri, Aloo Parantha &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;and all kinds of Chaat!
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What do I like to read?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I love to read fictitious storybooks like the all-time favourite series, Harry Potter, Keeper of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;Lost Cities, Artemis Fowl, The Unwanteds, The Percy Jackson series and many others!
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;Who is my role model?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;My all-time role model is the great author JK Rowling!
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is your biggest fear?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I am terrified of lizards! I am also scared of moths, caterpillars, wasps, honeybees and all kinds of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;insects.......
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is your favourite movie?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I don’t have a favourite movie per se, because I like all kinds of movies that I watch.
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is your favourite series?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;My favourite series is Greenhouse Academy, streaming on Netflix right now. I thought that 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;seasons were not enough for such an amazing storyline!
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is your favourite colour? <br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I think any person who knows me very well can answer this. My favourite colour is teal. Derived &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;from the eye colour of Fitz.
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is your favourite subject?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;Many people may judge me on this because students are not exactly favourable of this subject but my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;favourite subject is History!
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is your biggest pet peeve?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;My biggest pet peeve is when someone does not use proper punctuation and also when a person &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;boasts very much. I think that modesty is the best policy.
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;Who is your favourite singer?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;My favourite singers are Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Madison Hayes, Joshua Bassett and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;Naomi Scott.
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What’s one monument you would want to visit?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;The one monument I would want to visit is the Parthenos in Greece. I want to see the Athena &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Parthenos because I have heard a lot about the mystery surrounding it. Even though it is a replica &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;of the original, I would still like to see it.
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What is the thing that you hate?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;I hate rollercoasters because they make me nauseous and dizzy.
<br><br>
Q.&emsp;What do you love the most?<br>
A.&nbsp;&emsp;Books… All kinds of books.
